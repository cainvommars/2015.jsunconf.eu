The JS Unconf will start each day at 9AM. Saturday evening will be an event at a secret location. All locations will be described in our [location section](http://2015.jsunconf.eu/location/).

After the breakfast which starts at 9AM we will vote together which talks we want to see during the day.

We will have four parallel tracks and each slot has 45 minutes. You can organize your talk as you wish, between presentation, demo, discussion, Q&A, etc.

Speakers can add the links to their slides to our wiki: [https://github.com/jsunconf/2015.jsunconf.eu/wiki](https://github.com/jsunconf/2015.jsunconf.eu/wiki)

Between each slot there are breaks for drinking coffee and sharing experiences.

The Unconference ends on Sunday around 5PM. The night before the conference we are organizing a pre party.
