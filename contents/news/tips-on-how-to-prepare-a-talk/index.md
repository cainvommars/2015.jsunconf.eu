So you decided that you want to visit the JSunconf this year. As you might know a unconference lives from the visitors and he Talks are prepared by the visitors and get choosen in the morning of each conference day by the crowd. This gives everyone the chance to prepare an awesome talk. This is where you all come in.

If you work in a special environment, or you started an open source library or you have worked with a special library. It would be great if you can share your expirience with the conference. 
What also apply's is if you have a deep knowledge of something (git, angular.js, react or pick any topic) it would be awesome if you can share your failures, experiences, learnings or conclusions.

Anothere cool thing is if you have a great interesst in something and you might have accomplished to do some tutorials, and you are interessted in more information from people which already worked a longer period of time with that technologie you may organize a discussion group.

But in any case this a D.I.Y. conference. And everybody should share something to the community. There will be time to find partners for a joined talk.

Overall the most important rule for a unconference is "DON'T PANIC!". Nobody expects you to prepare fireworks and laser shows for your Talk (But if you want to do it go ahead, but please give us a head up for the fireworks ;-)).
