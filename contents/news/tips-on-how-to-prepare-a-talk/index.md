So you decided that you want to visit the JS Unconf this year. As you might know a unconference lives from the visitors and the talks are prepared by the visitors and get choosen in the morning of each conference day by the crowd. This gives everyone the chance to give an awesome talk. This is where you all come in.

If you are terrified to speak in public or you have no idea how to prepare a talk you should take a look at [speaking.io](http://speaking.io/)

If you work in a special environment, or you started an open source project or you have worked with a special library, It would be great if you can share your experience with the audience. 
What also applyies is if you have a deep knowledge of something (git, angular.js, react or any other topic) it would be awesome if you can share your failures, experiences, learnings or conclusions.

Another cool thing is if you have a great interest in something and you might have accomplished to do some tutorials, and you are interested in more information from people which already worked a longer period of time with that technology, you may organize a discussion group.

But in any case, this a D.I.Y. conference. And everybody should share something to the community. If you are scared to speak alone you may find a friend or colleague who can can hold a talk with you.

Overall the most important rule for a unconference is "DONâ€™T PANIC!". Nobody expects you to prepare fireworks and laser shows for your talk (But if you want to do it go ahead, but please give us a head up for the fireworks ;-)). 

Here are some links which may be useful for creating a good talk
