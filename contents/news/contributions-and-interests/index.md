Your contributions, talks and discussions are essential for the Unconference. We created an application where you can collect your interests and proposals: [Contribs & Interests](http://contriboot.jsunconf.eu/)

Please check out http://contriboot.jsunconf.eu/ and submit your talks and what talks you are interested in!

Everyone is invited to give a talk at JS Unconf: at the days of the conference we all vote together which talks we would love to see - the talks with the most votes will be put on the schedule then.

We are looking forward to many awesome sessions with you at the Unconference!
